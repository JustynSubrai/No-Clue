# Swindle-Shop
Tired of being constricted by laws about what you can buy? Have some uranium that you need to get rid of, or need some for outshining your classmates at the next science fair? Well look no further. Here at Swindleshop, we offer a marketplace where you can buy and sell anything â€¦ and we mean anything. (Swindleshop does not hold any liability or accountability for items sold).

This project consisted of creating an interactive full-stack application. Multiple technologies were used as listed below. This application provides a simple and straightforward way for the user to buy or sell items quickly and efficiently. We allow the user to sell anything and the buyer to buy anything. Once the transcation is complete there is no opportunity to leave a comment, review, or return purchased merchandise. 

## Technologies Used

-JavaScript
-Node.js
-Express.js
-Handlebars.js
-Cloudinary
-HTML
-CSS
